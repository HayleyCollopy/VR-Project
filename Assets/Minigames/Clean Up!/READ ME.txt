This is Clean Up! The goal of this VR MiniGame is to clean up the table! In any means necessary...
Make sure there are no food items left on the table within the 10 seconds, and you win!

You can be as messy as you want in this VRmini, you could pick up each item individually (which would take a very long time) 
OR, you could just flip the table, but that's up to the player to figure out. Something I wish I could control was how the objects would interact when the table is being picked up by the player.
If the player picks up the table too fast, some items on the table will clip into the the table or phase through the surface.

The 3D assets, materials and skybox were created by myself. The only assets I used in this scene that I didn't make were the royalty free wood textures of the floor & tables made by Nomaxim on TurboSquid.
